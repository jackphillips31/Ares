Welcome to **Ares**, a modern, modular, and cross-platform game engine designed to empower developers to build immersive 2D and 3D experiences. Ares is built from the ground up in C++, with an emphasis on performance, flexibility, and ease of use. Whether you're prototyping a simple game or building a complex application, Ares provides the tools and features to bring your ideas to life.
@section Key Features
 - **Modular Design**: Easily customize the engine with features like window management, event systems, logging, and custom layers to suit your project's needs.
 - **Cross-Platform Support**: Ares leverages modern libraries and tools like WinAPI, OpenGL, and Dear ImGui for seamless development  across platforms. **NOTE**: The project currently only has Windows implementations.
 - **Extensible Shader System**: Create and manage shaders with support for multiple types and seamless integration with the rendering pipeline.
 - **Entity Component System (ECS)**: Keep your codebase clean and maintainable with a data-driven ECS that emphasizes separation of data and functionality.
 - **Asynchronous Asset Loading**: Load assets efficiently with the built-in thread pool, designed for smooth performance without blocking the main thread.
 - **Customizable Rendering**: From 2D graphics to 3D models, Ares offers a robust rendering system with support for buffer layouts, mesh optimization, and multiple textures per material.
## Built For Developers
Ares is designed with developers in mind, offering:
- A robust **logging system** for debugging and tracking, including support for both console and ImGui logging.
- An intuitive **event system** for handling user input and inter-layer communication.
- Seamless integration with **Premake** for project generation, allowing you to focus on development without worrying about configuration.
## Philosophy
Ares embodies a developer-first philosophy:
- **Scalability**: Optimized for high-end gaming PCs while remaining adaptable for a wide range of projects.
- **Transparency**: With an MIT license, Ares is open-source and welcomes contributions from the community.
- **Future-Proofing**: Designed to evolve, with plans for dynamic thread pools, advanced physics, and more.
